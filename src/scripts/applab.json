We heard about Alice and the rabbit hole from cartoons, books, and movies, so most people are familiar with them. In addition, there are metaphors related to Alice found in many modern stories. We believe in combing Carroll's works in mathematics and logic with stories from Alice in Wonderland. This experience will be both entertaining and educational.\n\nLewis Carroll invented a tool - the Carroll Diagram(1886) - to visualize the attributes of things that we re-created in Carroll’s Riddles. Aided with this interactive Carroll Diagram, you can only make your way out of the tree hole by tackling the logic riddles. ",

We’re in a dystopian reality in which the Nazi army ended up defeating the Allied Front and winning the Great War. In this apocalyptic parallel universe, Hitler has declared himself Supreme World Chancellor and, what’s even more terrifying, Tyrolean pants are all the rage across the globe.\nHowever, there’s still hope. Despite the scarcity of resources, the Allied resistance’s brightest scientists, led by the eccentric Dr. Ivan Ivanovich, have made the impossible possible: they’ve built a time machine.\nThus, thanks to the Quantum Air Combat Simulator, the Virtual Reality prototype designed by Dr. Ivanovich, you’ll have the opportunity to travel back in time and take part in the most momentous air battles of World War II.\nBut pay attention! Playing with quantum reality and altering the path of history can have the most unforeseen consequences…\n  \nClassic Essence / VR Technology\nSit in front of the huge 3D Quantum Simulator screen, fasten your seatbelt and relive the magic of legendary vertical scrolling titles.\nAlternate the “classic” point of view with the first-person perspective, while performing impossible maneuvers to dodge enemy fire. Be amazed by the dynamic scenario elements that will pop off at you. Never has a simulation seemed so real and fast-paced.\n  \nAir Combat / Immersion Zones\nAs Ivanovich Games already did in the successful “Operation Warcade”, all the scenarios in “1976: Back to Midway” include several Immersion Zones, which allow the player to move inside the aircraft cabin, offering new and thrilling challenges. An experience that only Virtual Reality can provide. \nTake control of the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and the B-17G Flying Fortress exact replicas, test your pilot skills, become a flying ace, and change history forever.\n",

While it does not deal with the science behind pandemics, it is designed to equip you with foundational algebra skills to understand how to make informed decisions about a critical public health issue.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nA mathematical approach from the comfort of your room.\n\n- Experience how a virus spreads through everyday activities and join a task force!\n- Explore virus containment strategies hands-on (literally!) and discover how math modeling can inform public policies \n- Feel, touch, and move to develop mathematical intuition and discover the underlying structure of exponentials\n- Get fluent with graphing and equations and determine when a virus overwhelms our city's hospitals and save the city!\n\nThe key concepts discovered and explored in this module are aligned to the Common Core State Standards and have been carefully designed by experienced educators to target and resolve key misconceptions at the root of fragile understandings in Algebra. This module was developed with support from the National Science Foundation.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nMath is not boring anymore. \n\nPrisms’ built-in math tools enable players to experiment, iterate, and gain fluency faster.

[10th grade student]\n\nI loved that I was able to see the virus spread. If people knew that, they would be more careful. [10th grade student]\n\nI could be in the graph and understand exactly how it works and relate it back to my ‘real world’ experiences with the virus … I could actually see the exponential growth and multiplicative pattern. I think this will be really big for kids like me who have trouble visualizing things. [10th grade student]\n\nStudents persevered through rigorous content in an innovative way through the Prisms of Reality platform in ways we’ve never seen before. The delivery method of content is a game changer for our school.

We’re in a dystopian reality in which the Nazi army ended up defeating the Allied Front and winning the Great War. In this apocalyptic parallel universe, Hitler has declared himself Supreme World Chancellor and, what’s even more terrifying, Tyrolean pants are all the rage across the globe.\nHowever, there’s still hope. Despite the scarcity of resources, the Allied resistance’s brightest scientists, led by the eccentric Dr. Ivan Ivanovich, have made the impossible possible: they’ve built a time machine.\nThus, thanks to the Quantum Air Combat Simulator, the Virtual Reality prototype designed by Dr. Ivanovich, you’ll have the opportunity to travel back in time and take part in the most momentous air battles of World War II.\nBut pay attention! Playing with quantum reality and altering the path of history can have the most unforeseen consequences…\n  \nClassic Essence / VR Technology\nSit in front of the huge 3D Quantum Simulator screen, fasten your seatbelt and relive the magic of legendary vertical scrolling titles.\nAlternate the “classic” point of view with the first-person perspective, while performing impossible maneuvers to dodge enemy fire. Be amazed by the dynamic scenario elements that will pop off at you. Never has a simulation seemed so real and fast-paced.\n  \nAir Combat / Immersion Zones\nAs Ivanovich Games already did in the successful “Operation Warcade”, all the scenarios in “1976: Back to Midway” include several Immersion Zones, which allow the player to move inside the aircraft cabin, offering new and thrilling challenges. An experience that only Virtual Reality can provide. \nTake control of the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and the B-17G Flying Fortress exact replicas, test your pilot skills, become a flying ace, and change history forever.\n",

Set the time-of-day to view sunrises and night lights. Complete challenges to recover satellites to the space shuttle.\n\nSave The World! An asteroid is heading towards Earth. Navigate through the asteroid's tunnels to plant explosives to destroy it in a race against time. 15 levels with 3 levels of difficulty.\n\nThe Space Station: Float around the outside of the Space Station and view the fully working Canadarm remote arm and visiting HTV supply vessels. Complete a puzzle fixing solar panels - randomly different puzzle every time.\n\nDownload directly to your headset by clicking the Oculus App button, top right. Please leave a review if you like it. Contact me about anything you don't like!\n\nControls:  \nThe trigger buttons thrust forward and backwards in the direction you are looking. Alternatively, the left and right thumbsticks allow you to thrust forwards, backwards, sideways and rotate / roll.\nThe grip buttons grab objects.\nButtons A, X or Menu open the options menu. \n\nMotion Sickness:  \nNot everyone is cut out to be an astronaut so if you are easily affected by motion sickness in VR, then this app probably isn't for you. That said, there are a couple of things that will help. (1)  Use the right trigger button to move in the direction you are looking, rather than using the joysticks to move and rotate. Stick to slow turns. (2) In the Earth scene, set the Earth animations to \"OFF\" to make your position over the Earth instantly jump between locations when you change it, rather than smoothly animating which gives the sensation of flying across the Earth. (3) Just because you can do back-flips and rolls, maybe don't!  (4) Leave Auto-Stabilize on (it is on by default). Only the very bravest switch this off to give a truly weightless feel!\n\nGuide videos on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXz0shLcVlTgnCBcrj9Jw9w\n\nJoin in on Discord: https://discord.gg/bVH873n9Wm",

Link added.\n\n\n\n\n\nFree demo version available also on Sidequest:\nhttps://sidequestvr.com/app/1966/solicitude-wake-up-demo\n\nSolicitude Wake-up takes you to seemingly abandoned research facility. You wake-up in a dark operating room, laying down on operating table. As you start finding your way out from the facility, you start to hear voices coming from other parts of the facility and face all kinds of disturbing things . Your only help is the flashlight, that you found from the room that you woke up, but unfortunately it is running out of batteries.\n\nSolicitude Wake-up tries to imitate the real world interactions as closely as possible, while still maintaining ease enough controls to make the experience smooth. Nearly every object in game is interactable in some way. You can pick up and examine almost any object in game. You really need to carry the flashlight in your hand by keeping grabbing it. You need to collect and change the batteries to the flashlight and you need to pick up and use the key cards to the door locks.\n\n*****UPDATE 04.11.2020*****\nBig changes have been made based on received user feedback.\n\nAll graphics content and lighting is now revised. Game is not so pitch black anymore and all textures, effects and post processing have been upgraded.\n\nGame now features:\n\n*Full realtime lighting\n\n*Full realtime shadows\n\n*Full screen space reflections\n\n*Full screen space ambient occlusion\n\n*Split toning\n\n*Bloom\n\n*Tone mapping\n\n*HDR lighting\n\n*Advanced materials and textures\n\nAll this while maintaining full constant 72fps performance!\n\nInventory is redesigned to accept direct grabbing also and not only distance grab.\n\nPlease continue to send feedback and we continue to listen to your thoughts in coming updates!",

    "description": "\nShoot, slash, dodge and survive to blade combats in multiple kind of challenges to test your skills and claim your place in the Omega Blade hall of fame.\n\nIMPORTANT: From now on, the App Lab release integrates the Oculus Services Platform to provide instant access to your profile data, friends info, achievements and more.\n\n##### FEATURES\n\n**Multi range combat** - Close, middle and lange range combat with flying droids and biped robots.\n\n**Full body action** - You set your own peace and combat style based on. Decide the way you want to play it.\n\n**Enemy types** - There are several kind of enemies, and they attack or defend themselfs in different ways.\n\n**Challenges** - Omega Blade don't set a single infinite wave, but a large number of challenges with different weapons, enemies, life, stage and goals combination to keep surprising the player and provide all kind of new feelings.\n\n**Leaderboard** - A leaderboard shows your position in each  challenge, so you can try to dominate it.\n\n**Per match rival** - Each time you play a challenge, the system will pick a target rival score, and your main goal will be to overscore it.\n\n**Friend list** - You will be able to know your position among your friends playing Omega Blade in each challenge. Try to rule over them.\n\n**Achievements** - 50 achievements including events such as challenge completion, number of enemies destroyed, accuracy, execution style, your control over reflected bullets and more. \n\n**Body weapons grab** - In the challenges menu, the screen will show you the weapons available and their body position. During gameplay, move your hand close to the weapon region and grab it.\n\n\n\n##### WEAPONS\n\nThe current set of weapons to be used in early access challenges are:\n* Revolver\n* Machinegun\n* Shuriken\n* Sword\n* Shield grenade\n* Sniper rifle\n* Dual Edge\n\n\n##### GAMEPLAY HINTS\n\n* **Weapon grab**\n\nOnscreen icons will appear when you  indicate what weapon each hand is over.\nShoulder items can be grabbed easily placing the hand in front of the face.\n\n* **Two hands grab**\n\nLong weapons such as the machinegun, shotgun, sniper rifle or the spear must be grabbed using both hands. Some weapons like the machinegun will lose accuracy if used one handed, and others like the spear will not extend their energy blades.\n\n* **Weapon discard**\n\nJust launch the weapon and it will explode on it's own after a few seconds and will come back to your body.\nGrenades will come back to your body on launch only if they were not activated pressing the index trigger.\n\n\n* **Sword and knife grab to grip**\n\nWhen your hand thumb points down, you will grab the edge weapon with standard grip. If your hand thumb points up, you will grab the weapons with an inversed grip. \n\n\n* **Juggle**\n\nYou can launch and regrab your weapons before they autodestructs. \nThis is useful to perform a fast blade grip change, change a revolver from one hand to the other... or just to feel cool.\n\n\n* **Defensive bullet Reflection**\n\nYou can use blades to reflect bullets and defend yourself. Some game modes are based on this action\n\n* **Combo bonus**\n\nWhen you destroy enemies in a stake you will get combo points. The combo counter will reset if you don't destroy a new enemy soon.\n\n\n* **Enemy destruction bonus**\n\nDestroying an enemy shooting down a certain weak point can provide a coreshot bonus. Most enemies have some points that can be destroyed individually or in group to obtain an additional bonus prior to destroying them. Experiment shooting enemies down piece by piece to discover how to trigger each one of them and maximize your score.\n\n\n* **Energy color patterns**\n\nTake into account that neutral energy enemies (yellow) can be destroyed with any weapon, but alpha and beta energy enemies (green and red) can only be destroyed with their same kind of energy. \n\n* **Energy match game mode bonus**\n\nSome game modes will ask you to reflect alpha and beta energy bullets with the correct weapon to gain a bigger bonus. Others will ask you to destroy targets using only the right energy or a penalization will be applied. \n\n* **Energy breakdown**\n\nA wrong blade weapon crashing a positive or negative surface will result in the blade desintegration (but will be regenerated in the body).\n\n\n* **Hand poses**\n\nWhile single hand weapons are grabbed, the pose will be modified attending to your thumb and index position. Some poses may become helpful when using some weapons.\n\n\n* **Radar**\n\nIf you aren't able to find a pending enemy to shoot it down, remember you can press the right controller A button to display a 3d map on top of your hand. Press A again to dismiss it.\n\n\n* **Snipering**\n\nThe sniper rifle zoom is controlled by means of a yellow dot placed in the scope. Grab it and a virtua line will appear from the scope to your hand. Make the line longer or shorter to control the zoom level.\nThe scope is further from your eye to allow you to press your arms againts your body to increase your accuracy.\n\n\n* **180º and 360º Combat**\n\nSome stages will keep the action focused in the front, while other stages labeled as 360º ones will allow enemies to be deployed and attack you from any direction.\n\n\n\n##### ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM\n\n I started developing this game because I didn't find the kind of experience I really would like to play when Oculus Quest was released. I expected for a long time a more physical challenge, with few to no aid on performing cool actions, so that anytime you do something cool you feel proud of it.\n\nThe game took several forms until its current state after I played a lot with my friends. It became an easy to use game that everbody can enjoy, but hidding at the same time a set of layers that hard players will use to their advantage or to become a real badass inside the game.\n\nHope you all enjoy it!",

The game utilizes a unique set of mechanics that allow each player to control the speed of their opponent’s projectiles. Bullet time mode can be activated at any time, but while active it restricts the player to room-scale movement only and removes their ability to reload. These mechanics create an unparalleled combat experience that seamlessly blends fast paced action with tense strategy. War Yards combines these innovative gameplay systems with incredibly detailed stylized maps to make for a truly unforgettable VR western adventure.\n\nFeatures\n- Challenge your friends to intense and highly strategic 1v1 duels.\n\n- Utilize incredibly unique multiplayer bullet time mechanics to outsmart your opponent.\n\n- Explore 4 highly detailed stylized maps inspired by classic western settings.\n\n- Enjoy the freedom of playing with users across nearly all VR platforms.\n\n**[Join Us On Discord](https://discord.gg/cEezgFB)**",

Wake up in the middle of nowhere, and break free from nightmares!<br/>\n\nIn times where electronic music has taken over the VR scene, there's no stressing this enough: <br/>\n\nRock'n roll is not dead: **it's never been more alive!** <br/>\n<br/>\n\n##### Scope of the demo (as of today)\nThe purpose of this demo is to present a vertical slice of Smash Drums from the core gameplay loop:\n1. One song: Lover Boy - Kid Dope\n1. Four handmade tracks: easy, normal, hard, extreme\n1. A leaderboard!\n1. One level: the prison\n1. A forward-facing mode (the \"couch\" mode)\n1. Game modifiers (**faster** mode, no flying debris, barbarian)\n1. A boring tutorial<br/>\n\n##### Features and content for future updates of the demo\n1. Another song?\n1. A kickass tutorial!\n1. Surprises\n<br/>\n\n##### Features and content that will make it to the game upon release\n1. 21 rock songs from very (very) talented indies\n1. More environments\n1. Drums & sticks customization and collectibles\n<br/>\n\n##### Additional notes & how to give feedback\nSmash Drums is currently under development, and many features are yet to be finalized and adjusted according to players' feedbacks. <br/>\n\nThere are three options for feedback, and I will love you forever if you do so: \n1. **NEW!** Discord: https://discord.gg/ypeuDAc (see social links on the page)\n1. Twitter: my DMs are open, \n1. e-mail: contact@smashdrums.com\n\n\n\n### TL;DR:\nPlay the demo and have fun! <3",

This will provide some kind of replayability.\n\n- Interactions are done with either pressing Trigger which uses VR Hand position or \n  by holding the Grip and Point with Laser to the object and pressing Trigger\n- Laser Colors : \n  A. Red : means you aren't able to interact with the object yet\n  B. Yellow : means you are too far from the object to interact\n  C. Green : interaction is possible\n\n*There are some rare cases where laser interaction wont be possible, you may want\n to step away from the object and try again pointing on it.\n\n- UI ONLY INTERACTIONS  : some objects, like Electronic Passwords or Locks may be interacted\n  only with the use of Laser Pointer (Hold Grip)\n\n- Inventory : You may check and inspect items you have collected. The usage of items is\n  done automatically, also when an item is used it will be removed from inventory.\n\n- Difficulties : Playing on Easy will not result in a loss, even if time runs out. However\n  on Normal/Hard you have less time and when time runs out it will result in a loss. Playing\n  on higher levels will provide bigger score bonuses.\n\n- Saving : Progress is saved ONLY when you Complete a level. This will Unlock next Level and \n  current level's difficulty. \n\n- Gems : gems will provide (depending on color) score bonuses, thus this item is auto-consumed \n  and it will not appear on inventory.\n\n- Statues : same as gems but this time they provide extra Time.\n\n- Papers/Letters : some papers can be collected, but other will not. Also you may notice that when \n  you complete a puzzle some papers will dissapear, this is normal as they are no longer needed.\n\nThat's All! Enjoy!\n",

    "description": "From 1967 until 1985, guests at Disneyland had the opportunity to ”travel into the incredible universe found within a tiny fragment of a snowflake.\"  The attraction, Adventure Thru Inner Space, sought to use the tools of cinematic set design to explore the lessons of science, with massive structures representing water molecules and elaborate projection revealing the microscopic world of the atom.  The ride was developed during Walt Disney's final years, when he repeatedly explored how the tools of filmmaking might be repurposed to explore worlds beyond cinema in his theme park. Adventure Thru Inner Space was groundbreaking not only in introducing the Omnimover and by creating an attraction almost wholly focused on backgrounds (with no characters except for the onboard narration) but in the way it arranged dramatic, themed space toward educational goals.  \n\nSeveral years ago we released a beta version of this software; in recent months, we have worked to arrange an updated version worthy of a wide public release. The time for that release has come. Now you have the ability to experience this extinct Disneyland attraction on your  Oculus Quest. So join us as we journey back in time to look at--what was then imagined--as the future of science.\n\nDevelopment Team:\nJeremy Marx\nKurt Pfeifer",

    "description": "The most playful way of breathing. Meditative and deeply relaxing breathwork journeys.\n\n\nFlowborne is a meditative biofeedback breathing game. It conveys a healthy breathing style in an intuitive and playful way. Your breath is used as a game controller. You place the controller on your belly and use your breath to move through the game world. Every inhale creates a magical path in front of you, every exhale propels you forward. The game takes you on 24 meditative journeys through fascinating and soothing environments. Let your breath move you and allow yourself to let go.\n\n\nFlowborne is created by psychologists with stress reduction and relaxation in mind. It is based on scientific research on stress reduction, biofeedback and virtual reality. An empirically validated algorithm utilizes the hand controller to pick up the subtle respiration-induced abdominal movements. The virtual environment reacts to your breathing in real-time, thus guiding your attention and helping you to perfect your breathing style. Flowborne combines deep relaxation with meditative breathing.\n\n\n\n\nWe also created a smartphone version of Flowborne.\n\niOS: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flowborne-breathing-meditation/id1544753081\n\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vunderwelten.flowborneapp",

    "description": "VR Platforming Game, that gives you the freedom to move across the environment with superhuman abilities. Conquer over 35 levels with new obstacles and challenges. Compete for the fastest times or explore the environment. Experience the freedom of movement.\n\n\"TO THE TOP is still one of the most singularly fun experiences I've ever had inside my VR headset\" 9/10 - [UploadVR](https://uploadvr.com/top-review-one-best-times-can-vr/) \n\n\"Making the leap onto your must-play list\" 9/10 - Official PlayStation Magazine\n\n### FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT\nOur core motivation for creating TO THE TOP was to create a movement mechanic that is simple to use, takes advantages of VR input, and feels very comfortable to play. We spent a year testing and tuning this system, until it felt like a movement system that was not only fun to use but also opened the door to create brand new gameplay that has not been seen in platforming games before.\n\nClimb - Grab with one hand at a time, to move across surfaces, up over or around. You can climb 360 around objects.\n\nLeap- Grab on with both hands, look at where you want to go and release to leap. Perform consecutive leaps to build up speed and power.\n\nAir Control - While leaping through the air, you can control your fall with the direction you are looking.\n\nSkate - Green surfaces can be skated on. Grab them, point in the direction you want to go and skate across the surface.\n\nFly - Equipped with Jet Hands, you can fly through the sky.\n\nAnd more \n### DEPTH OF GAMEPLAY\nInspired by classic platforming games like the Super Mario series, we wanted to distil what made the genre so great and bring these concepts back in a brand new way. With this in mind we were able to bring a new level of skill, challenge, and discovery to VR. So you can come back again and again in the pursuit of bettering your skills and master the game.\n\nEasy to Pick Up - Controls are easy to use and do not require many buttons or gestures. New or hardcore gamers can easily jump into TO THE TOP.\n\nHard to Master - To earn the best times and collect all of the items. You need to master all of the movement mechanics to pounce though the levels like a robotic cheetah.\n\nLearn the Environment - Each level can be traversed not only horizontally but vertically as well. It is important to learn these layouts and figure out the best paths through the levels.\n\nChallenging Obstacles - Each new level brings a new challenging obstacle to overcome ranging from Wall Runs to a giant moving robot you need to climb.\n\nHidden Areas - Discover hidden paths in each level to earn a Medal.\n\n### HOURS OF CONTENT\nTO THE TOP is the start of something great and we wanted to make sure players had a complete package of a game with hours of content to discover\n\n35 Levels to Play - Each level brings new challenges and environments to discover.\n\nOver 30 Customizable Options to Unlock - Customize your robot ranging from hands, torso, and head.\n\n3 Time Goals to Conquer Per Level - Each level has multiple time goals that range in difficulty.\n\n2 Collectable Goals Per Level - Take your time and explore each level to discover Geoms to collect and a Hidden Medal.\n\n### SOUNDTRACK\nTO THE TOP was made in Austin, TX and we were inspired by the local music that is a part of our scene. We are fortunate to have their music on the TO THE TOP soundtrack. So make sure to play with headphones on and turn it all the way up!\n\nMusical Artists\n\nCapyac\n\nMirror Mask\n\nNight Drive\n\nSlooom\n\nSip Sip\n\nLanguage Support for: Arabic, Chinese (China), Chinese (Hong Kong), Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French (Canada), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian (Nynorsk), Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Russian, Spanish (Mexico), Spanish (Spain), Swedish, Turkis",

The first iteration of V-Speedway will be a small but complete game mixing arcade driving with real world inspired races, featuring the following:\n\n- Three very different cars, each from a different era and class.\n- Three racetracks, each with short and long variants.\n- Single Race and Time Attack mode.\n- Additional class-specific game modes.\n- Various liveries for cars, helmet, suit and gloves.\n- Online leaderboards.\n\nFuture plan\n-----\nAfter v1.0 is out, I will add content to the game depending by player interest, downloads and ultimately sales. I'd love to add Online Multiplayer soon after, followed by more cars, tracks, and in general more features.\n\n**Thanks for stopping by, see you on the racetrack!**\n\n[Changelogs]: https://github.com/DanjelRicci/V-Speedway/releases\n[Discord server]: https://discord.gg/cHtPANW",
